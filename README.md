## ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS ON THE FOLLOWING:
### Torque,Count of Engine Type,Engine Type
- The most common engine type is the single-cylinder engine, followed by the parallel-twin engine.

- The average torque for a single-cylinder engine is 18 Nm, while the average torque for a parallel-twin engine is 46 Nm.

- The most powerful engine type is the V-twin engine, with an average torque of 72 Nm.

- The least powerful engine type is the air-cooled, single-cylinder engine, with an average torque of 9 Nm.

- The most common engine type in electric motorcycles is the electric engine, with an average torque of 59 Nm.

Also
- The torque of an engine is directly related to its power. The higher the torque, the more powerful the engine.

- The torque of an engine is also affected by its engine displacement. The higher the engine displacement, the more torque the engine will produce.

- The torque of an engine is also affected by its engine type. V-twin engines and parallel-twin engines typically produce more torque than single-cylinder engines.

- The torque of an engine is also affected by its cooling system. Liquid-cooled engines typically produce more torque than air-cooled engines.

These insights can be used by motorcycle manufacturers to design and develop motorcycles that meet the needs of different riders. For example, a rider who needs a powerful
motorcycle for long-distance touring may want to choose a motorcycle with a V-twin engine. A rider who is looking for a lightweight and fuel-efficient motorcycle may want to choose a motorcycle with a single-cylinder engine.


### Model,Count of Drivetrain,Drivetrain
- Chain drive is the most common drivetrain type, followed by shaft drive and belt drive. Chain drive is relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain, but it requires more frequent lubrication and adjustment than shaft or belt drives.Shaft drive is the most reliable drivetrain type, but it is also the most expensive. Belt drive is a good compromise between chain and shaft drives, offering good reliability and lower maintenance requirements than chain drive, but at a higher cost than chain drive.

- Chain drive is the most common drivetrain type for motorcycles with smaller engines, while shaft drive is the most common drivetrain type for motorcycles with larger engines. This is because chain drive is lighter and less expensive than shaft drive, making it a good choice for motorcycles with smaller engines. Shaft drive is more robust and can handle the higher torque output of larger engines.

- Belt drive is a good choice for motorcycles that are ridden in wet or dusty conditions. Belt drives are less susceptible to wear and tear from these conditions than chain drives.
 
- Electric motorcycles typically use chain drive or belt drive. Chain drive is the most common drivetrain type for electric motorcycles, because it is inexpensive and easy to maintain. Belt drive is also a popular choice for electric motorcycles, because it is quiet and does not require lubrication.
Here are some additional insights:

- The type of drivetrain can affect the performance and handling of a motorcycle. Chain drive is the lightest drivetrain type, so it can improve the acceleration and top speed of a motorcycle. Shaft drive can add weight to a motorcycle, but it can also improve the stability and handling of the motorcycle, especially at high speeds. Belt drive is a good compromise between chain and shaft drives, offering good performance and handling without adding too much weight to the motorcycle.

- The type of drivetrain can also affect the maintenance requirements of a motorcycle. Chain drives require more frequent lubrication and adjustment than shaft or belt drives. Belt drives require less maintenance than chain drives, but they do need to be replaced periodically. Shaft drives are the most reliable drivetrain type and require the least maintenance.
  
- The type of drivetrain can also affect the cost of a motorcycle. Chain drives are the most inexpensive drivetrain type, followed by belt drives and shaft drives. Shaft drives are the most expensive drivetrain type.

And so 
- Motorcycle drivetrain data can be used to derive insights into a variety of factors, including:

- Rider behavior and preferences. For example, by tracking how often riders shift gears, you can learn about their riding style and preferences. This information can be used to develop new products and features that meet the needs of riders.

- Motorcycle performance and efficiency. Motorcycle drivetrain data can be used to measure and improve the performance and efficiency of motorcycles. For example, by tracking fuel consumption and engine RPM, you can identify areas where improvements can be made.

- Motorcycle reliability and durability. Motorcycle drivetrain data can be used to identify and address potential reliability and durability issues. For example, by tracking the failure rates of different components, you can identify components that need to be redesigned or strengthened.

- Motorcycle safety. Motorcycle drivetrain data can be used to develop new safety features and technologies. For example, by tracking how riders use the brakes and throttle, you can identify potential hazards and develop features to help riders avoid them.

Here are some specific examples of insights that can be derived from motorcycle drivetrain data:

Which gears are used most often? This information can be used to improve the design and spacing of gears.

How often do riders shift gears? This information can be used to develop new transmission technologies, such as automatic transmissions.

What is the average fuel consumption of a motorcycle? This information can be used to develop more fuel-efficient motorcycles.

What is the average engine RPM of a motorcycle? This information can be used to develop more efficient engines.
